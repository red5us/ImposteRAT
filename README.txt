~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites before running:
----------------------------
in order to run the program you need to install:

pip3 install pyautogui (for the screenshot feature).

I also recommands to run it on Windows Terminal and not cmd. (for console color issues)

#######################################################################################

also on the 'client.py' you need to change the ip address 
to the ip address that your host are running.

#########################################################

Run the server.py
after that run the client.py 
to start. (it does not matter what goes first.)

Enjoy, and Thank You.
